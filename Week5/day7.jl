# Week 5 â€“ Day 7: Julia â€“ Functional Programming & Composition


# Julia is a multiple dispatch language that also excels at functional programming
# making it perfect for expressive, high-performance code. 
# Today youâ€™ll explore how Julia handles first-class functions, closures, broadcasting, and composition.


# First-class functions â€“ assign to variables, pass/return from other functions
#     ex: f(x) = x + 1
# Function composition â€“ âˆ˜ and |> (pipe)
#     ex: f âˆ˜ g or f(g(x))
# Anonymous functions â€“ 
#     ex1: x -> x * 2
#     ex2: x -> x^2
# Higher-order functions â€“ map, filter, etc.
#     ex: map(f, xs) or custom apply_twice(f, x)
# Closures â€“ functions that capture outer variables
#     ex: make_adder(n) = x -> x + n
# Broadcasting â€“ functional operations over arrays: f.(arr)
#     ex: f.(xs) applies f elementwise



# First-Class & Anonymous Functions
double = x -> x * 2
double(5)  # 10

add = function(x, y)
    x + y
end
add(3, 4)  # 7

f = x -> x^2
f(4)  # 16


# Higher-Order Functions
map(x -> x^2, [1, 2, 3])  # [1, 4, 9]
filter(x -> x > 1, [1, 2, 3])  # [2, 3]


# Function Composition (âˆ˜)
f1(x) = x + 1
g(x) = x * 2
h = f1 âˆ˜ g  # h(x) = f(g(x))
h(3)  # 7

# double(x) = 2x
square(x) = x^2
composed = square âˆ˜ double
composed(3)  # (2*3)^2 = 36

add1(x) = x + 1
# double(x) = x * 2
f = double âˆ˜ add1
f(3)  # (3 + 1) * 2 = 8


# Piping (|>)
3 |> double |> sqrt  # sqrt(6) â‰ˆ 2.45


# Closure
function make_multiplier(n)
    return x -> x * n
end
times3 = make_multiplier(3)
times3(5)  # 15


function make_adders(n)
    [let j = i
        x -> x + j
     end for i in 1:n]
end
adders = make_adders(3)
adders   # 11
adders   # 12
adders   # 13


# Broadcasting
double.(1:5)  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]




# Exercise 1 â€“ Function Factory
# Create a function make_adder(n) that returns a function adding n to input.
function make_adder(n)
    return x -> x + n
end 

make_adder2 = make_adder(2)
println(make_adder2(3))

# Exercise 2 â€“ Apply Twice
# Write apply_twice(f, x) that applies a function f to x two times.
function twice(f, x)
    f(f(x))
end

println(twice(x -> x + 1, 3))  # 5

# Exercise 3 â€“ Anonymous Map
# Use map(x -> x^2, [1,2,3,4]) to square each number.
println(map(x -> x^2, [1,2,3,4]))

# Exercise 4 â€“ Composition
# Use âˆ˜ to compose two functions double and square, then test.
r(x) = x + 2
t(x) = x * 2 
w = r âˆ˜ t
println(w(4))

# Exercise 5 â€“ Broadcasting
# Write a negate(x) function and broadcast it across a vector.

function negate(x)
    return -x
end

println(negate.(1:4))  # â†’ [-1, -2, -3, -4]

# ğŸ˜… lmao i got this wrong bc i was like wtf do you mean negate 
# but that was what they meant

    # function negate(x)
    #     return x * 4 
    # end 

    # println(negate.(1:4))


# Exercise 6 â€“ Chain Operations
# Create a pipeline that:
# 	1.	Starts from a vector [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# 	2.	Filters values > 3
# 	3.	Squares them
# 	4.	Returns the sum

using Statistics

[1,2,3,4,5,6] |>
    x -> filter(y -> y > 3, x) |>
    x -> map(y -> y^2, x) |>
    x -> sum(x) |>
    println # 77

# âœ… Cleaner pipeline
# println(
#     [1,2,3,4,5,6] |>
#         x -> filter(y -> y > 3, x) |>
#         x -> map(y -> y^2, x) |>
#         sum
# )
